        <h1>The Design Agency Project Workflow</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
               <h4> Phase 1: Discovery & Strategy (The "What" and "Why")</h4>
               <ol>
                <li>Client Briefing: The process starts when a client approaches the agency with a need (e.g., "We need a new website," or "Our brand feels old"). The agency conducts an in-depth consultation and helps the client create a Creative Brief. This document defines the project's goals, target audience, brand values, scope, budget, and timeline.</li>
                <li>Research & Analysis: The agency team (strategists, designers) conducts market research, competitor analysis, and audience research to understand the landscape and define the core problem and opportunity.
                </li>
                <li>Strategy: They develop a clear plan or strategy that outlines the creative direction, key messages, and visual approach to meet the client's business goals.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Phase 2: Creative Concept & Design (The "How")</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ideation & Conceptualization: The creative team (designers, art directors, copywriters) brainstorms and sketches initial concepts, mockups, and wireframes based on the approved strategy.</li>
                    <li>Design Development: They bring the chosen concepts to life, focusing on visual elements like layout, typography, color palettes, and imagery. For digital projects, this includes UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Phase 3: Client Review & Iteration (Refinement)
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Presentation: The agency presents the initial designs to the client, explaining the rationale behind the creative choices and how they align with the strategy.</li>
                    <li>Feedback & Revisions: The client provides feedback. This stage is iterative, meaning the agency refines the design through one or more rounds of revisions based on the agreed-upon feedback cycles until the client is satisfied.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Phase 4: Production & Launch (The Delivery)</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finalization of Assets: Once the design is approved, the agency prepares the final deliverables. This could mean readying files for print, handing off web designs to developers, or building out the final code for a website or application.</li>
                    <li>Launch: The final product (e.g., new website, brand rollout, marketing campaign) is released to the public.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
