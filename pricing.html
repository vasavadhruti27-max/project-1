                <h1>Fixed-Price / Project-Based Model:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>How it works: A single, set price is agreed upon for the entire scope of work, including clear deliverables and timelines.

                    </li>
                    <li>Best for: Projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., a simple logo design, a 5-page website redesign).</li>
                    <li>Cons: Any significant changes or additions (scope creep) will require a separate, extra cost and can lead to disputes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Hourly Rate Model:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>How it works: You pay for each hour of work completed. Rates vary significantly based on the agency's location and the designer's experience.</li>
                    <li>Best for: Small, ongoing, or undefined projects where flexibility is key (e.g., ad-hoc design updates, brief consultations).</li>
                    <li>Pros: Transparent cost breakdown of time spent. Highly flexible for changing needs.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Retainer Model (Monthly Pricing):</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>How it works: You pay a fixed monthly fee for ongoing services or a set number of hours. The agency becomes a continuous design partner.</li>
                    <li>Best for: Businesses with consistent design needs (e.g., marketing assets, ongoing UI/UX support, social media content).</li>
                    <li>Pros: Guaranteed availability of a design team and predictable monthly expense.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Value-Based Pricing:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>How it works: The price is based on the perceived business value or ROI (Return on Investment) the design is expected to generate, rather than hours or deliverables.</li>
                    <li>Best for: High-impact, strategic projects where the design directly drives significant revenue (e.g., a UX redesign expected to increase sales conversions by 30%).</li>
                    <li>Pros: Aligns the agency's success with the client's business outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
